## About
The project is focused on creating a warehouse system, named "Bosch warehouse" in this case.

The requirements are that we have 4 main features:
 - Employee management: make it to add employees to the warehouse, give these employees certain information like having a forklift certificate and if they are busy or not.

 - Shelf management: Shelves will be used to store pallets which contain products.This makes us of adding shelves,organizing them based of amount of items stored.

 - Pallet management: Pallets are used to store items, These items contain certain info like name, max amount able to be stored on the pallet and ofcourse how many are being stored at the moment. We are able to add pallets, remove/add items, and reallocating pallets.

 - Warehouse function: In the warehouse we have certain functions. First of all the warehouse contains the shelves which contain the pallets, and it contains the employees. The functions include being able to pick a certain number of products out the warehouse, adding products and rearranging the shelves. There is also acces to the subfunctions from other requirements.


The Project contains 2 parts that are runnable:
1: Main showcase: This shows all possiblities and how it works.
2: Testcases: This is used to validate the working during making of the program and afterwards as proof aswell.
